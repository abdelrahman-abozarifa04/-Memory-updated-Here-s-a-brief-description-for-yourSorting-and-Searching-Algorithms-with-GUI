# Sorting and Searching Algorithms with GUI 🔍📊

Welcome to the **Sorting and Searching Algorithms with GUI** project! This Java-based application offers a comprehensive visualization of popular **sorting** and **searching** algorithms, enhancing learning and understanding. With an interactive **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, users can explore how each algorithm works, observe their performance, and gain valuable insights into their operation step-by-step.

## Project Overview 💡

This project allows users to visualize various **sorting** and **searching** algorithms in action. The graphical interface animates the algorithm's processes, helping users understand their functionality, performance metrics, and the underlying principles.

### Key Features 🌟

#### Sorting Algorithms 🌀
- **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: Selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and swaps it into place.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array and merges the sorted sections back together.
- **Quick Sort**: Divides the array into partitions and recursively sorts them.
- **Heap Sort**: Converts the array into a heap structure, then extracts the elements in order.

#### Searching Algorithms 🔎
- **Linear Search**: Sequentially checks each element until the target is found or the end is reached.
- **Binary Search**: Efficiently searches a sorted array by dividing it into halves and checking the middle element.

#### Graphical User Interface (GUI) 🎨
- **Visualization:**
  - Step-by-step animation showing sorting and searching processes.
  - Highlights elements being compared, swapped, or searched for.
  
- **User Interaction:**
  - Input custom arrays or generate random arrays.
  - Start, pause, and reset controls for executing algorithms at the user's pace.
  - Real-time display of the current state of the array and algorithm progress.

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Track and display the number of **comparisons** and **swaps** made.
  - Show the **elapsed time** for each algorithm’s execution.

### Technologies Used 💻

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Libraries:**
  - **Java Swing**: For building and managing GUI components and layout.
  - **Java AWT**: For graphics rendering and user interface customization.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 🧑‍💻

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of **Java** and **algorithms**.

### Installation and Setup 🛠️

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/abdelrahman-abozarifa04/sorting-searching-gui.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```sh
    cd sorting-searching-gui
    ```

### Compilation ⚙️

3. **Compile the project:**

    ```sh
    javac -d bin src/*.java
    ```

### Running the Application ▶️

4. **Run the application:**

    ```sh
    java -cp bin Main
    ```

## Usage Guide 📚

1. **Input Array:**
   - Manually enter a custom array of numbers or click to **generate a random array** for testing.

2. **Select Algorithm:**
   - From the dropdown menu, choose your desired **sorting** or **searching algorithm**.

3. **Control Execution:**
   - Use the **start**, **pause**, and **reset** buttons to control the flow of the algorithm’s execution.

4. **View Results:**
   - Watch as the algorithm runs, showing comparisons and swaps in real-time while tracking the number of operations and time taken for execution.

## Future Enhancements 🚀

- Add additional advanced algorithms (e.g., **Radix Sort**, **Ternary Search**).
- Integrate more **visualizations** to compare different algorithms on the same dataset.
- Include detailed **explanations** and educational content for each algorithm.
