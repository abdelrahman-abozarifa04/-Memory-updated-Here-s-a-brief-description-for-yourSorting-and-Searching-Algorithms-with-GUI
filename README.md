# Sorting and Searching Algorithms with GUI

Welcome to the Sorting and Searching Algorithms with GUI project! This Java-based application implements various sorting and searching algorithms, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing and interacting with the algorithms. The project aims to provide an educational tool for understanding different algorithms and their performance characteristics.

## Key Features

### Sorting Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Heap Sort**

### Searching Algorithms

- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

- **Visualization:**
  - Animates the sorting process step-by-step.
  - Highlights elements being compared and swapped.

- **User Interaction:**
  - Allows users to input custom arrays or generate random arrays.
  - Provides controls to start, pause, and reset the visualization.
  - Displays the current state of the array and algorithm progress.

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Shows the number of comparisons and swaps.
  - Displays the elapsed time for algorithm execution.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java
- **Libraries:**
  - **Java Swing:** For GUI components and layout.
  - **Java AWT:** For graphics and rendering.
