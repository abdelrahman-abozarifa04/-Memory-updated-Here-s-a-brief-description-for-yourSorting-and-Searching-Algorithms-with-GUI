Linear Search
Binary Search
Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Visualization:
Animates the sorting process step-by-step.
Highlights elements being compared and swapped.
User Interaction:
Allows users to input custom arrays or generate random arrays.
Provides controls to start, pause, and reset the visualization.
Displays the current state of the array and algorithm progress.
Performance Metrics:
Shows the number of comparisons and swaps.
Displays the elapsed time for algorithm execution.
Technologies Used
